  <h3>Wantaway star Cristiano Ronaldo has been pictured knuckling down in training with his Manchester United team-mates
    ahead of their Premier League opener at home to Brighton this weekend.

    New boss Erik ten Hag and his United side continue their preparations, as they begin their new league campaign at
    Old Trafford on Sunday.The 37-year-old, who wants out of United, just a year after he made a sensational return from
    Juventus, was among the squad being put through their paces by the Dutchman.Ronaldo was captured in action on
    Thursday at the Red Devils' Carrington training base and boss ten Hag has a big decision on his hands.


    The Dutchman may have to start Ronaldo, despite his lack of pre-season training with fellow forward Anthony Martial
    reportedly set to miss their opening game of the season due to injury, according to The Athletic.

    The Frenchman, who notched three goals on tour, suffered a minor hamstring problem and the timing of his return is
    unclear.Whether he starts or not, Ronaldo is still hoping to leave Old Trafford in the coming weeks.

    The former Real Madrid star has had a disrupted pre-season as he didn't travel with the rest of squad on their
    pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons. Instead, he remained in Portugal and trained alone.

    Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with a summer move for Ronaldo but all three clubs
    have distanced themselves from those reports.</h3>

  <h3>Barcelona have issued Manchester United a final date before they will have to call off their pursuit of Frenkie de
    Jong.

    The Netherlands midfielder has been a target at Old Trafford for most of the summer, with manager Erik ten Hag keen
    to orchestrate a reunion with his ex-Ajax charge.Negotiations have proven difficult, however, with little headway
    being made to close a deal.

    While Barca are willing to sell, in order to ease their huge salary commitments, De Jong is a different story.

    The player is unconvinced over the benefits of a move to Old Trafford at this point, with United out of the
    Champions League for 2022-23 and something of an unknown quantity under their new boss.If any transfer is to finally
    take place, United will have to step up their efforts in the next 10 days or risk losing their target.Barcelona
    president Joan Laporta has set a strict deadline after which no more transfers will be considered.

    "We are doing everything possible to register the signings. We have to do it before August 13," the chief explained,
    while affirming that he was "optimistic" that La Liga would accept Barca's new signings for the coming season.

    Barca hope to register Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie, Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Jules Kounde in time for
    the new campaign, after exercising various economic 'levers' in order to free up new funds.

    The club would nevertheless welcome the injection of funds that De Jong would bring in, plus the removal of his
    salary burden would help in registering the new signings - or even bringing more in, as Laporta hinted.

    "We will see what happens," he added to reporters, amid reports that Manchester City star Bernardo Silva is the
    latest player to be targeted by the Catalans.</h3>

  <h3>It's not just Arsenal and Premier League clubs making huge statements in the summer transfer window as Bayern
    Munich have completed the signing of Sadio Mane.

    The Bundesliga giants confirmed the move on Tuesday and as per the BBC, Liverpool will receive 32m euros (£27.4m)
    with an additional 6m euros based on appearances, plus 3m euros for individual and team achievements taking the
    overall package to 32m euros (£35m).Bolstering an attack that already includes Robert Lewandowski, Leroy Sane and
    Kinglsey Coman, Mane is looking forward to a new challenge: "This is the right time for this challenge," he said at
    his unveiling. "I felt the great interest of this big club from the start so there was no doubt in my mind."And this
    deal could be fantastic news for the Gunners - although not because it could open the door for some supporters to
    get their wish of a Serge Gnabry return amid reports that he could be sold by Bayern Munich this summer if he
    doesn't sign a new contract which has just over a year left to run.

    As explained by The Athletic, Arsenal have not discussed the Germany international as an active target due to his
    expected wage demands. Furthermore, the report states that it would be a huge surprise if the 26-year-old ends up at
    the Emirates Stadium before the window closes.

    Instead, Mane's move to Bayern should benefit the Gunners simply by not having to prepare for him when facing
    Liverpool home and away in the Premier League or in the domestic cup competitions next season as the Senegal
    international often haunted the north London outfit during his time in England.

    In 18 appearances against Arsenal across all competitions, Mane netted eight goals - Crystal Palace (13), Manchester
    City (10) and Aston Villa (9) are the only other teams in the division he fared better against - as he clearly
    relished facing the Gunners whether that be for Southampton or Liverpool.pon arriving in England from Red Bull
    Salzburg in the summer of 2014, the forward scored or claimed an assist against Arsenal in each of his eight
    seasons. In addition after opening his account for Liverpool on his debut in the opening game of the 2016/17
    campaign at the Emirates Stadium - his favourite goal for the club.

    "Wow! I will say my first goal at Emirates Stadium against Arsenal on my debut," he revealed. "And then after, my
    second goal, I will say against Bayern Munich, against Manuel Neuer! Sorry Manu, I am coming but I think the second
    goal was also unbelievable! So, I will pick these two goals."

    As Mane only failed to score once in six meetings with Arsenal at Anfield, the Gunners will be glad to see the back
    of him. However, his exit won't make games against Liverpool even easier as Jurgen Klopp can still call upon Mohamed
    Salah, Roberto Firmino, Luis Diaz and big-money summer signing Darwin Nunez in attack next season.

    With that said, Diogo Jota has already shown signs of taking up the Mane mantle against Mikel Arteta's side. The
    Portugal international has only faced the Gunners 11 times in his career but they are already one of his favourite
    opponents with eight goals too - including four in four last season.

    So whilst not having to face Mane is certainly great news from an Arsenal perspective, fans ought to be hopeful that
    Arteta has devised a plan to stop Jota from improving his goalscoring record as he will surely be Liverpool's
    biggest threat when the two sides lock horns in the 2022/23 campaign.</h3>
