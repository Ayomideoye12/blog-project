  <h3>Paulo Dybala will not be signing for Manchester United or any other Premier League club, since he has landed from
    a flight to put the finishing touches to a transfer to Roma.

    Dybala became a free agent upon the expiry of his contract with Juventus in June. It is somewhat surprising that it
    has taken him a few weeks to find a new club. But there have been several interested parties all along.

    First of all, it seemed like he was set to sign for Juventus’ rivals Inter Milan. However, they pulled out of a
    move, which led to fresh claims about a Premier League transfer with Manchester United.

    Dybala was a target for Man Utd back in the summer of 2019, but a deal never came to fruition. He has understandably
    remained on their radar since. But he will instead be staying in Serie A.

    The Argentina international has been in talks with Roma recently. Now, he is ready to sign for Jose Mourinho’s side
    despite their lack of Champions League football.

    Gianluca Di Marzio of Sky Sport revealed on Monday morning that Dybala “will be a new Roma player”. He will be
    signing a three-year contract with the club from the Italian capital, worth €6m per season (around £97,800 per
    week).

    In fact, Dybala has just landed in Portugal, where Roma are undergoing a pre-season training camp. Once there, he
    will take his medical and link up with Mourinho’s squad.

    Roma are due to play Sporting CP in a friendly on July 19th and Nice four days later. Another friendly will take
    place in Israel against Mourinho’s former side Tottenham Hotspur – another former contender to sign Dybala – on July
    30th.

    Dybala could be involved in them as he prepares for his first season with someone other than Juventus since 2014-15,
    which was his last with Palermo.

    Paulo Dybala deal monumental for Roma
    One year after sending shockwaves by appointing Mourinho as their manager, this will be another monumental signing
    for Roma.

    For many, Dybala is the highest-profile player they will have signed since another Argentine, Gabriel Batistuta, in
    2000. Batistuta was a club-record signing at the time. Therefore, getting Dybala on a free transfer will be
    brilliant business.

    There are also indications that he will wear the number 10 shirt at Roma. It has been vacant since their greatest
    ever player, Francesco Totti, retired in 2017.

    To be fair, it may not be the biggest miss for Man Utd; they have signed Christian Eriksen in a similar position
    anyway. But other clubs could be envious of Dybala’s talents being expressed elsewhere.

    For many a year, that was Roma, watching on as he shone for Juventus. Now, La Joya will be part of La Magica’s
    squad. It will be one of the most high-profile free transfers this summer.</h3>

  <h3>That's according to bookmakers Sky Bet, who've slapped 1/20 odds for the Brazilian to stay in the French capital,
    with Man City the next likely destination at 10/1.There have been strong rumours regarding the Brazilian's future
    all summer, with a move to Chelsea or a return to Barcelona the most likely destinations.

    But it now seems clear that the £200million man will continue his stay in France, with his contract that still has
    three years left on it.

    The winger has 160 goals and assists in his 140 games for PSG and has helped them to four league titles and six
    other domestic titles.

    However, the club are still yet to win the Champions League trophy that their big spending owners are desperate for
    despite possessing one of the most star studded teams in world football.


    Chelsea were 4/1 to favourites to sign the winger not even two weeks ago but Sky Bet have already lengthened the
    odds for the Brazilian to move to West London to 16/1.On the off chance that Neymar does leave France this summer,
    Manchester City are now deemed as the most likely destination at 10/1.

    The English champions have already signed youngsters Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez as new attacking players, so
    it's unlikely that City would be prepared to splash a sizable amount of cash on the 30-year-old.

    Juventus and Real Madrid are priced as the next most likely at 25/1, while Arsenal, Liverpool, Barcelona and Bayern
    Munich are all 33/1.

    Newcastle, Tottenham and Aston Villa are all much longer shots at 40/1, 50/1 and 66/1 respectively.</h3>
